# **mementoMood**
*Web application for the Memento Mood app*

Looking for ideas to develop my knowledge of web apps development, I thought of this idea

This project revolves around the *"memento mori"* idea, which is 
> to remember death

## The calendar

Taking inspiration from this idea and the various calendars made to put into perspective
how short our lifespan is, I wanted to make an app to that accomplished the same function.
A calendar that gets filled with each passing day from the day the user was born until 80 years of age

### Mood tracker

This idea seemed too simple to take advantage of all of the Django functions,
therefore, I thought of combining a daily mood tracker with this calendar. 
Rating each day 

### Social media functionality

In order to increase the dificulty of implementation of the app,
I decided to include the option for users to write comments and reflections on their day like a Twitter post
which they can publish anonymously or not, which they will be able to:
- edit (only on that day)
- delete

This will work like a social media app with:
- comments
- likes
- save to favorites
- share link
- Trendiest

Users will also be able to publish their whole calendar for others to see,
and other users will be able to see the comments on each day
